# My Groccery server.
*Requires mongodb*

This is the server for my grocceryClient, a project to learn a javascript framework, (vue.js), along with furthering understanding of node.js.



The point of this application is to allow recipie storage along with groccery trip planning. 



Api generated with loopback, no need to re-write the wheel... 
Client uses axios to post and get data to manage the groccery list.
